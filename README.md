tmux-conf
=========

My tmux configuration. Built upon the excellent foundation provided by Brian P. Hogan's excellent book "tmux". Actually. to be perfectly honest there's not much here yet EXCEPT that foundation.


Additional Notes
================

Make sure to add the following to the end of .bashrc to get full color support under Linux:

  [ -z "$TMUX" ] && export TERM=xterm-256color

For support for system clipboard, make sure to install "xclip" package.
